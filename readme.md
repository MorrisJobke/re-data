# re-data

This project is the ongoing effort of providing an simple JSON interface for conferences. 

Example data includes [re:publica](http://re-publica.de) or [30C3](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2013). Take a look at the `scrapers` directory.

## Documentation

Documentation on the API can be found [here](doc/api.md)
